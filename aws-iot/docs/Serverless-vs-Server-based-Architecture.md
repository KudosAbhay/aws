# Inference:

<b>Serverless Is Better Because</b>:
1.  Reduces amount of time needed to code new functions
2.  Reduces costing of overall implementation and runtime executions
3.  Just In Time registration (on AWS IoT) is already present, which in server-based applications will be needed to coded from scratch
4.  DynamoDB is not available outside AWS. Hence, faster read/write scale won't be available in server-based architecture.
5.  No Need to Create API Gateway via code, as AWS / Azure provides API Gateways readily along with shadows to communicate with devices.
